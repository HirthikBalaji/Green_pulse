## 🌿 App Idea: **GreenPulse Campus**

**Tagline:** *“Small actions. Big impact.”*

A **gamified sustainability app** that tracks eco-friendly behavior of **classes/departments** and rewards them with **Green Points** to promote a cleaner, healthier campus.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

Instead of blaming individuals, the app **rewards collective responsibility**.

Each **class / section / department** earns points by **avoiding common mistakes** and **doing positive eco-actions**.

Leaderboard + rewards = behavior change.
